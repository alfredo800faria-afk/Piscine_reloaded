Here's the implementation of `ft_iterative_factorial.c` according to the requirements:

This function:
- Returns 0 for negative inputs (error case)
- Returns 1 for inputs 0 and 1 (base cases of factorial)
- Uses an iterative approach with a while loop to calculate factorial for positive integers
Uses only basic arithmetic operations and control structures (no allowed functions needed)
Will execute in O(n) time, which is well under the 2-second requirement for reasonable input sizes

The factorial calculation starts from 2 (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the result) and iteratively multiplies up to `nb`.
